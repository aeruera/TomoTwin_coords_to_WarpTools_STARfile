# TomoTwin_coords_to_WarpTools_STARfile
TomoTwin is a particle picking software tool used in cryoET. At the end of a TomoTwin pipeline, a .coords coordinate file is produced which is not in a compatible format for exporting particles from WarpTools. This script will convert the .coords file produced from TomoTwin to a WarpTools 3 dev36-compatible STAR file.
